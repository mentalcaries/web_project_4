# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

Project 4 builds on previous knowledge of responsive web design, this time with the inclusion of some very basic Javascript.

The page creates a photo gallery for the user who can edit his/her name and title. The gallery is arranged in a grid view with cards of fixed sizes.

**Javascript**

* JavaScript was used here in order to create a modal form that allowed the user to access and change the Name and title on the profile. For the time being, the profile photo remains fixed.

**HTML/CSS**

*HTML and CSS here were fairly straightforward in terms of creating the layout. The website was designed to be responsive down to a minimum resolution of 320p.
